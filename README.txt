MobWars (Legacy)
_______________________________________

As MobWars is an ongoing project, updatable, this was its humble beginnings: code that was created trying to find a system for the game but, ultimately, incomplete. This is the start of MobWars, and, while it's my most primitive work, it is the spark of my career as a programmer. 

This was what created my intuition for programming. So, it's something to be kept somewhere, depsite it being a non-working project.
