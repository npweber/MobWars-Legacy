# MobWars-Legacy
**Disclaimer** 

This project is not professional work and is merely kept to preserve the remnants of effort I put into programming my first computer program, MobWars.

##  Idea
MobWars was a concept Minecraft minigame involving the control of mobs, other entities in the game that interact with the player, in this case, hostile mobs that attack the player. The idea for the game was to lead a squad of mobs to defeat an opponent's squad of mobs. Then, whoever was more tactical with their leadership could essentially win the game. MobWars was to be developed as a "Bukkit plugin", meaning it would be a server-side modification to Minecraft, running the minigame.

## Its Current Status
This minigame is concept because this original idea was never implemented, due to lack experience in Bukkit (now known as Spigot) plugin development. After the files in this repository were created and worked with, I abandoned the work and decided to start developing smaller-scale Spigot plugins in order to practice developing in Java and Spigot. After having enough experience developing plugins, I rethought the concept and found that substituting players for mobs in the squads was easier to implement. With that plan, development started in 2017 in the repository [MobWars](https://github.com/npweber/MobWars) and finished later that year. [MobWars](https://github.com/npweber/MobWars) was the real success of this concept and lives on as a finished professional work today. MobWars-Legacy is kept as nostalgia.
